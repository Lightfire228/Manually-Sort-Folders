Manually Sort Folders
---------------------

This extension for Thunderbird 3.0.1+ adds a "Manually sort folders" entry into
the Tools menu. Use it to, hum, manually sort your folders (that was obvious,
wasn't it?).

Just run make and it will build the .xpi for you. Use install.rdf.template if
you need to bump the version number, *not* install.rdf (it is overwritten each
time).
