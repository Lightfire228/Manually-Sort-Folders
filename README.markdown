Manually Sort Folders
=====================

This extension for Thunderbird 3.0.1+ adds a "Manually sort folders" entry into
the Tools menu. Use it to, hum, manually sort your folders (that was obvious,
wasn't it?).

I sometimes put a development version
[online](http://jonathan.xulforum.org/files/tbsortfolders.xpi), but over the
past two years, I've only updated this addon once, as it is very stable; so your
best bet is to just stick with the publicly available version on AMO.
