- Don't jump to the top if possible when clicking "refresh".
- Collapse all folders by default in the UI folder pane.
- Don't display accounts that use the global inbox in the "Sort Accounts" tab
- Use margins for <groupbox>es
- Remove the stupid "sample folder pane above" and put the *real* folder pane
  --> use a flowable layout with 0-width descriptions and splitters to enlarge
  the tree.
- Add an option to apply the sorting logic to the "Favorites" folders (if
  possible simply).
- Add a tab that allows you to arbitrarily style a folder. The UI would be like
  the "Filters" dialog of Thunderbird. For [pick a folder, a folder that has
  depth + textbox], apply the following rule [color, underline, bold, icon,
  hide]. [+] [-]

  Each rule would be an XBL widget. However, there's already a MailTweak
  extension that does most of this.
- Move the dialog to the "Preferences" dialog of the add-on (simpler) --> use
  nsIWindowMediator to access main window's variables such as gFolderTreeView
- See if there's a simple way (like: hacking the root RDF source) to sort
  Address Books
- Enable drag&drop for sorting folders in the real folder pane [ETA: 2 weeks]
